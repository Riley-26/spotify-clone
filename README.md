# Spotify Clone

React/JavaScript

This program features a playlist from the user's actual spotify, displaying the information after the user authenticates their account. It uses the Spotify API to access this data. After getting the user's account, the program will play songs if prompted, and will display the song currently playing on their official spotify app. Because the data is fetched from the API, it is dynamically updated and guaranteed to be secure through the use of the inaccessible API key. The spotify app has to be open to work properly. Applications of this program are vast, and could be something similar to this: a GUI for an LED screen, displaying data dynamically when the user is listening to spotify.

I made this program, following along with an educational video, making sure to understand everything that was happening. Further, it taught me how to apply the best practices of React/JavaScript, e.g. ES6+ JavaScript and naming conventions.
