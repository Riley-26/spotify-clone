React/JavaScript

This program features a playlist from the user's actual spotify, displaying the information after the user authenticates their account. It uses the Spotify API to access this data. After getting the user's account, will program will play songs if prompted, and will display the song currently playing on their official spotify app. Because the data is fetched from the API, it is dynamically updated and guaranteed to be secure through the use of the inaccessible API key.

I made this program, following along with an educational video, making sure to understand everything that was happening. Further, it taught me how to apply the best practices of React/JavaScript, e.g. ES6+ JavaScript and naming conventions.
